    "same_element": {
      "description": "When the Sun and Moon occupy signs of the same element (fire, earth, air, or water), there exists a natural harmony between conscious identity and emotional needs. This combination creates internal coherence between what one strives to become and what feels emotionally secure. The native experiences a sense of psychological integrity where outer expression aligns with inner needs. Fire element combinations bring passionate enthusiasm and creative confidence; Earth element combinations provide practical stability and sensory groundedness; Air element combinations create intellectual clarity and social adaptability; Water element combinations enhance emotional depth and intuitive sensitivity.

      "description": "When the Sun and Moon occupy signs of complementary elements (fire-air, earth-water), there exists a natural support system between conscious identity and emotional needs. Fire and air enhance each other's expansive qualities, while earth and water strengthen each other's receptive capacities. This combination creates a balanced flow between expression and reception, action and reflection. The native experiences a sense of psychological completeness where different but harmonious parts of the self work together effectively.

    "incompatible_elements": {
      "description": "When the Sun and Moon occupy signs of incompatible elements (fire-earth, air-water), there exists a fundamental tension between conscious identity and emotional needs. These elements naturally challenge each other's basic approach to life—fire's enthusiasm conflicts with earth's caution; air's abstraction contrasts with water's emotional immersion. This combination creates a complex psychological dynamic requiring conscious integration of seemingly contradictory needs. The native often experiences an inner struggle between what they consciously strive to be and what feels emotionally secure. While potentially challenging, this tension can ultimately lead to exceptional psychological depth and versatility when consciously worked with. The specific signs involved indicate the particular domains where this elemental tension plays out and how it might be most constructively reconciled through life experience."

    "incompatible_elements": {
      "description": "When the Sun and Rising sign (Ascendant) occupy signs of incompatible elements, there exists a notable contrast between inner identity and outer presentation. Fire-earth or air-water combinations create a first impression that significantly differs from the core self, sometimes serving as protection or compensation for more vulnerable inner qualities. This combination can create a complex, multi-layered personality where others must move past initial impressions to discover the true nature beneath. The native may experience tension between authentic self-expression and social adaptation, sometimes feeling misunderstood or judged based on surface impressions.

    "incompatible_elements": {
      "description": "When the Moon and Rising sign (Ascendant) occupy signs of incompatible elements, there exists a significant difference between emotional needs and instinctual responses to the environment. Fire-earth or air-water combinations create a protective layer between inner feelings and outer expression, often resulting in delayed emotional processing or a stoic exterior that masks deeper sensitivities. This combination can develop exceptional emotional complexity and depth, as the native learns to navigate the tension between immediate reactions and deeper emotional processing.
