    "domicile": {
        "description": "Domicile (also called rulership) represents a planet's home sign, where its essential nature is most purely and powerfully expressed. When a planet is in its domicile, it operates with maximum effectiveness, confidence, and natural authority. The energy flows without impediment, allowing the planet's core qualities to manifest with clarity and strength. Planets in domicile typically indicate areas of life where the native experiences natural mastery, inherent understanding, and the ability to express the associated qualities with minimal internal conflict or external obstruction. The planet's energy is neither excessive nor deficient, but rather perfectly calibrated to achieve its aims with grace and authenticity. Traditional astrology places special emphasis on planets in domicile, considering them to be 'dignified' and particularly beneficial in a chart, providing resources and strengths the native can readily access."
    },
    "exaltation": {
        "description": "Exaltation represents a sign where a planet expresses its qualities in an elevated, refined, or idealized manner. When a planet is in its exaltation, it operates with exceptional effectiveness, often expressing its highest potential and most admirable qualities. Unlike domicile, where a planet operates in its most natural state, exaltation brings an element of enhancement, elevation, and sometimes even transcendence to the planetary energy. Planets in exaltation typically indicate areas of life where the native may experience moments of brilliance, elevation above ordinary circumstances, and the capacity to express the associated qualities with particular grace or spiritual refinement. The planet's energy is amplified in a harmonious way, allowing its positive attributes to shine while minimizing its challenging ones. Traditional astrology considers exalted planets to be strongly dignified, providing special gifts and notable talents that often manifest in distinctive or remarkable ways."
    },
    "detriment": {
        "description": "Detriment represents a sign opposite to a planet's domicile, where its essential nature faces significant challenges in expression. When a planet is in detriment, it operates in an environment whose qualities naturally conflict with its core needs and function. This creates an inherent tension that requires conscious integration and adaptation to navigate effectively. Planets in detriment typically indicate areas of life where the native may experience initial difficulty, the need to develop compensatory skills, or situations that demand greater conscious effort to master. The planet's energy may manifest in compensatory waysâ€”either through overexpression (trying too hard) or underexpression (giving up too easily). However, planets in detriment can ultimately become sources of significant strength and unique perspective, as the native develops sophisticated adaptations and deeper understanding through working with these challenging placements. The growth potential is substantial, though it generally comes through conscious effort rather than natural facility."
    },
    "fall": {
        "description": "Fall represents a sign opposite to a planet's exaltation, where its refined qualities face particular challenges in manifestation. When a planet is in its fall, the environment's qualities tend to undermine or complicate the planet's ability to express its higher potential, creating a situation where its energies may become diminished, distorted, or require significant refinement to express effectively. Planets in fall typically indicate areas of life where the native may experience self-doubt, feelings of inadequacy, or situations that require substantial inner work to master. The planet's energy often manifests in ways that initially feel depleted or compromised, requiring conscious restoration and reintegration. However, planets in fall can ultimately become sources of profound wisdom and compassion, as the native develops humility, empathy, and deep understanding through working with these challenging placements. The spiritual and psychological growth potential is significant, though it generally emerges through confronting and transforming feelings of insufficiency or limitation."
